## Description  
In this lab, you are required to build a **View Page** â€” a simple presentation layer of a website that displays a list of data objects and provides interactive JavaScript functionality.

You must use a **data structure from your Java or Python project class**.  
If such data is not available, choose any task freely from the following list:

The emphasis of this lab is not on visual design but on **JavaScript functionality**, **DOM manipulation**, and **working with arrays**.

## Requirements

- Implement a **View Page** displaying your data items.
- The data must be taken from a **Java or Python class**. If unavailable, choose a predefined dataset from the link above.
- Implement the following features using **pure JavaScript**:
  - âœ… **Sorting** â€” allow sorting items by one of the fields.
  - âœ… **Search** â€” provide search/filtering through the list of items.
  - âœ… **Total Count** â€” display a total count or aggregated value (e.g., total price, total items).
- **Responsiveness is NOT required.**
- **Styling is optional** and completely up to you.
