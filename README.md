# Web Technologies & Web Design — Lab Assignments

## Student: Sklianchuk Bohdan  
Lab: 2  
Variant: 9

## Description  
Improve the previously created landing page (Lab 1) by adding **full responsiveness** and implementing **animations**.  
The page layout, design system (fonts, colors, spacing), and semantic structure should remain consistent with the original Figma design used in Lab 1.

This lab focuses on adapting the layout for a wide range of screen sizes — from mobile devices (e.g. iPhone 5s) to large 4K displays — and enhancing the user experience with dynamic elements using CSS animation techniques.

## Requirements:

- The website must be **partly responsive**, supporting at least:
  - **320px** width (e.g. iPhone 5s)
  - **2560px** width (e.g. 4K screens)
- For extra-large screens, content may remain inside a container and be centered horizontally.
- The **header must collapse into a hamburger menu** on small screens.
- The website must include **at least 3 animations**, which can be implemented using any method, but preferably with CSS (`animation` / `transition`).
- Project structure must be **logical** — do not place all CSS in one or two files. Use proper modular file separation (e.g. `base.css`, `layout.css`, `components.css`, etc.).
- **All requirements from Lab 1** must still be fulfilled:
  - Use of semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
  - Class names must be meaningful and consistently follow the **BEM** naming convention (or another consistent structure).
  - Visual fidelity to the Figma design (no pixel-perfect requirement, but should appear as intended).
  - Basic cross-browser compatibility (latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Edge).
  - Responsiveness is now **required**, unlike in Lab 1.
