# Web Technologies & Web Design — Lab Assignments

## Student: Sklianchuk Bohdan  
Lab: 5  
Variant: 9

## Description  
In this lab, you must implement **full CRUD functionality** using a **backend REST API**.  
All Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations must be performed via the corresponding **HTTP methods** (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT/PATCH`, `DELETE`).

You are expected to connect an **existing backend** you worked on during the previous academic year.  
If such a backend is unavailable, you should create a new one using any technology stack (Node.js, Java, Python, etc.).

## Requirements

- Connect your frontend application to a working **REST API backend**.
- Implement the following HTTP operations:
  - `GET` — retrieve list or single item.
  - `POST` — create a new item.
  - `PUT` or `PATCH` — update existing item.
  - `DELETE` — delete item.
- You may use any backend stack (Node.js, Java, Spring Boot, Flask, Express, etc.).
- Use **fetch()** or similar native JS methods for making HTTP requests.
- **Responsiveness is NOT required.**
- **Styling is optional** and fully up to you.
