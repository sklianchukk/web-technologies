# Web Technologies & Web Design — Lab Assignments

## Student: Sklianchuk Bohdan  
Lab: 1  
Variant: 9

## Description  
Create a landing page following the given design (Figma).

## Requirements:

- Use of semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<footer>`, etc.) wherever necessary.  
- All fonts, colour palette, and element sizes must strictly match the design.  
- Pixel perfect is not required, BUT the website should visually match the design template (e.g., if an element is centered in the design, it should look centered on the page).  
- All class names must not be meaningless (e.g., `class="myClass"`) and should follow a consistent naming convention (preferably BEM).  
- Basic cross-browser support — the website should look correct in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Edge.  
- Responsiveness is **not required** for now.
