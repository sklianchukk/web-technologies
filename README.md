# Web Technologies & Web Design — Lab Assignments

## Student: Sklianchuk Bohdan  
Lab: 6  
Variant: 9  

## Description  
In this lab, you are starting the development of a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React.js**.  
This project is the foundation of a basic **e-commerce platform**, and in Lab 6, you are required to build the **Home (Landing) Page**.

Your subject (products/items being displayed) must relate to your entity from Labs 3–5.  
The application must follow the design wireframes provided below and be built entirely using React components.

## Requirements

- Use only **React.js** — all markup must be written using JSX in `.js/.jsx` files. Do **not** modify `index.html`.
- Create the project using **Create React App**:  
- Your **Home Page** should include the following sections (as per wireframe):
  - Header
  - Navigation bar
  - Hero / Intro section
  - Footer
- **Styling is mandatory**:
  - You may use plain CSS, SCSS, or any React-compatible UI framework (e.g., styled-components, Material UI, Bootstrap, etc.)
  - However, a near-zero styling page is unacceptable.
- Create at least **5 separate React components** (one file per component).
- Use **functional components** only (no class components).
- No interaction is required in this lab — links/buttons don’t need to work yet.
- Use **clean code** principles and organize your component structure logically.

## Project Goal (Series of Labs 6–11)

Build a full SPA e-commerce platform with the following pages:
- Home (Landing)
- Catalog (Items list)
- Item page (Details)
- Cart (with Redux and Form)
- All CRUD actions (connected to REST API)

You may reuse and extend your backend server from Labs 3–5. If unavailable, build a new REST API (Node.js, Java, Python, etc.).


## Tech Stack

- React.js (with functional components)
- CSS / SCSS / styled-components / React UI Library (choose one)
- No responsiveness required, but page must work on latest **Chrome**
- Project structure must be clean and mo
